//! Builder Service Management
//!
//! This module contains types that are an interface between Reth node and the block building
//! service. This is where we acquire references to various node components and pass them
//! to parts of the block building service implementation.
//!
//! This is also the entrypoint for Reth to spawn the service and signal various system events
//! such as node startup, payload job requests, and others.

/// `spawn_payload_builder_service` is called by the node builder to spawn once and here we
/// have all the logic necessary to create a self-contained instance of the block building
/// service. This is where we take references to other components of the node, such as the
/// data provider, the pool, evm config and others.
///
/// The type that interfaces with the node is called `PayloadJobGenerator`, which is called
/// by Reth whenever the CL wants to start building a new payload. In case of Optimism L2,
/// this is done by the sequencer for every new block that is produced.
